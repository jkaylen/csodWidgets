# LXP Carousel Widget
Add LxP Carousels to your Welcome and Custom Pages! Note that the LO's will not render in CSOD Page Builder or Preview Mode, must save and then view as an end user.

## Important Notes
NOTE: This Widget can be added multiple times, just make sure to change the id="myLO2" (line 11) to a new name and reference that name in the getLXPWidget('Suggested','myLO2'); (line 13) command.

NOTE: Do not make this the last widget on your Welcome/Custom Page Design! The action menu for the LO's appear under each LO, so will be cut off if it's the last thing on the page.

NOTE: This only works with Carousals that are enabled for that user, ie if they don't have Featured turned on, do not put Featured in the code.

NOTE: The user must have Learner Home enabled

NOTE: Client portal must have JavaScript enabled on the Welcome Page

## Directions
1. Place either an HTML Widget (best for full/constrained) or a Formatted Textbox Widget (best if 2 or 3 widgets in the row)

2. Use the drop down in settings below to select the type:
- Machine Learning: TopPicks, Position, Subjects, Popularity, Playlists
- Admin Selected: Featured, Suggested, Required
- Other: Continue, Saved
3. If using a Formated Text box, you may wish to remove the Title in the settings below, else update the title to reflect which carousal type you are using
